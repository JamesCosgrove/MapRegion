#  Hello Carl!

## You'll need the latest version of Xcode to run this, thats version 13. However, it might be better to get the latest beta version as that's what I've been using. Its Version 14 beta 6, available here: https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode

## Once you manage to open the project, try running it in the simulator. It should work fine and show a map with five annotations around London.



## Next, take a look at the code. Go to the file called StageList2_MapApp

### Note: The map code itself is in the file called MapView, however if you follow the comments I've left it should provide a rough image of how the whole map works so it makes a bit more sense. The file called MapViewExtensions is where i think the new code needs to go. It's responsible for setting the region shown on the map.


## Finally, you can add/remove/edit the annotations to show whenever you like, just go to the file called Annotation+Landmark inside the Models folder, then add a line to the array on line 29.
